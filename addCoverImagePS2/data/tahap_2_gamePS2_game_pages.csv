To progress through the game, Felt will often need to coordinate with Viesa to get useful items for either solving puzzles or making battles easier.

Released in 2004, it is the third installment in the Conflict series. Gameplay Conflict: Vietnam has players taking control of Frank ""Ragman"" Wier, Bruce ""Junior"" Lesh, Will ""Hoss"" Schafer & Harold ""Cherry AKA Doc"" Kahler, a squad of four 101st Airborne Division soldiers on the eve of the Tet Offensive in 1968. Multiplayer Multiplayer for Playstation 2 allows two players to each control two of the squad's four men and take on Viet Cong (VC) members and North Vietnamese Army (NVA) forces. Multiplayer for Xbox allows up to four players to play together under local co-op. If three players decide to play on Xbox, one of the players will take control of two of the squad’s four men whilst the two other players will control the remaining squad soldiers individually. If two players just decide to play, then the same principle will apply like the PlayStation 2 version. Plot Conflict: Vietnam opens in 1968, just days before the Tet Offensive begins, as 19-year-old Private Harold ""Cherry (later known as Doc)"" Kahler is introduced to his squadmates on a Huey gunship heading to ""Ghost Town"", a 101st Airborne Division base in South Vietnam. Twenty-eight-year-old Staff Sergeant Frank ""Ragman"" Wier is the leader, highly familiar with the Vietnam War from two previous tours of duty. Corporals Bruce ""Junior"" Lesh and Will ""Hoss"" Schafer comprise the rest of the squad. Hoss is the squad's adrenaline-junkie machine gunner, while Junior, the squad sniper, is counting the final days of his tour. The Tet Offensive occurs just after Kahler's first combat patrol, and he and the rest of Ragman's squad soon find themselves cut off behind enemy lines after the helicopters deploying them on a night patrol are shot down. Over the next several days, the squad battles through miles of unknown jungle filled with hostile NVA and VC. After escaping a napalm strike, they meet up with ""The Chief"", commander of a Navy PBR. The Chief is alone prior to meeting up with Wier's squad, having dropped some Green Berets off up river where he ""saw some strange shit"". After fighting their way through a VC-fortified area called 'Charlie's Point', the men discover the Chief has been killed and soon meet up with a group of Montagnards. After retrieving a sacred statue and releasing several village prisoners for the leader of the village, the squad uses a radio gained as a reward to call for a helicopter extraction from the 1st Air Cav, being landed in a base under siege. After fighting off a heavy VC and NVA assault, the squad is praised by an overjoyed Major Wallace, who promises all of them commendations for their bravery. A dying VC throws a grenade into the bunker as the Major speaks, however, rendering them unconscious, and the five men are taken prisoner. Major Wallace is killed when the men are forced to play Russian roulette. Escaping from the VC POW camp, Ragman's squad fights their way through the jungle and meets Sergeant Stone of the SASR and his squad. The two sergeants lead their men through a series of VC tunnels that the SASR were ordered to destroy. They succeed, and Stone and Wier part on good terms. Meeting up with a USMC jeep, the squad joins up with a column of trucks and tanks headed for Huế. After battling through the war-torn city and destroying numerous NVA T-34s with an M48 Patton tank, the squad mounts up in a 101st Airborne Huey. While attempting to destroy HAWK surface-to-air missile batteries in the area that were captured by the NVA, the helicopter is shot down by an RPG, crash-landing near an NVA stronghold, the Citadel of Huế. The squad infiltrates the Citadel, taking the fortress and eliminating its garrison, including a handful of tanks and the commanding general. A closing cinematic, narrated by Kahler, tells what happens to the members of his squad after their tour. Hoss signs on for another tour, and Kahler eventually learns from a drunk CIA agent that he is fighting in Cambodia, seeking the thrill of combat. Junior finally goes home, but meets an unjust fate after he joins the Black Panther Party and is killed in a shootout with the FBI. Ragman comes home to an empty house and divorce papers, and moves to live in the Rocky Mountains with his dog, Ho Chi Minh, having found peace. Kahler moves to New York City, raises a family, and becomes a respected doctor, utilizing his experience as a combat medic to treat wounds caused by inner-city violence."

Released from August to December, originally for the PlayStation 2, it is the first installment in the Devil May Cry series. Set in modern times on the fictional Mallet Island, the story centers on Dante, a demon hunter who uses his business to carry out a lifelong vendetta against all demons. He meets a woman named Trish who takes him on a journey to defeat the demon lord Mundus, who is responsible for the deaths of Dante's brother and mother. The story is told primarily through a mixture of cutscenes, which use the game engine and several pre-rendered full motion videos. The game is very loosely based on the Italian poem Divine Comedy by the use of allusions, including the game's protagonist Dante (named after Dante Alighieri) and other characters like Trish (Beatrice Portinari) and Vergil (Virgil). The game was originally conceived by Capcom developers as Resident Evil 4. Due to the staff feeling it would not fit the Resident Evil franchise, the project became its own title. Several gameplay elements were also inspired by a bug found in Onimusha: Warlords. Devil May Cry received prominent coverage in the video game media due to the impact it had in the action-adventure genre, its high difficulty, and the high overall scores given to it by professional reviewers. The game has sold more than three million copies, spawned multiple sequels and a prequel, and is considered among the greatest video games of all time."

The game is a prequel to the original Devil May Cry, featuring a younger Dante. Set a decade before the events of the first Devil May Cry in an enchanted tower, Temen-ni-gru, the story centers on the dysfunctional relationship between Dante and his brother Vergil. The game introduces combat mechanics with an emphasis on combos and fast-paced action. The story is told primarily in cutscenes using the game's engine, with several pre-rendered full motion videos. Devil May Cry 3 was released in February and March 2005 for the PlayStation 2 and ported to Microsoft Windows in June and October 2006. It was widely praised by critics, hailing it as a return to form for the series, yet did receive some criticisms for its high level of difficulty in the North American release. It was re‐released in 2006 as Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition, featuring retooled difficulty levels, the addition of mid-mission checkpoints, ""GOLD mode"", and Vergil as a playable character. Combined sales of both versions were over 2.3 million. It has been cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. A 2005 manga prequel to Devil May Cry 3's storyline was published in Japan and later the United States. Gameplay Man dressed in red, shooting in a dimly lit room Dante firing Ebony and Ivory at an opponent. The gameplay in Devil May Cry 3 consists of levels, missions, in which players battle enemies, carry out platforming tasks and solve puzzles to progress through the story. The player's performance in each mission is graded from D through C, B and A, with top marks of S and SS. Grades are based on time taken to complete a mission, the number of red orbs (currency obtained from defeated enemies) gathered, ""stylish"" combat, item usage and damage received. The games tracks stylish combat by an on-screen gauge, which is the performance of a series of attacks (""combos"") while avoiding damage. The longer a player attacks without repetition and evades damage, the higher the score. The gauge registers ""Dope"" after a few attacks, progressing through ""Crazy"", ""Blast"", ""Alright"", ""Sweet"", ""SShowtime"" to peak at ""SSStylish"". If Dante receives damage, the style rating falls; if the gauge is ""Crazy"" or below, it will reset. Devil May Cry 3's battle system allows a player to link attacks, with each weapon having a set number of attacks. Devil Trigger is a mechanic which enables the player's character to assume a demonic form. This alters the character's appearance, increases attack and defense, restores health and enables special attacks. This is a departure from the previous titles, where Dante draws power from weapons and items he procures throughout the game. The Devil Trigger state lasts as long as there is energy in the Devil Trigger gauge; the gauge rises by attacking or taunting enemies in normal mode, and falls when using the Devil Trigger transformation or other abilities using Devil Trigger power. The Devil Trigger mode is not available to Dante until one-third of the way through the game, while Vergil, playable in the special edition, has the ability at the outset. The other major difference from previous Devil May Cry games is Devil May Cry 3's combat system, which allows a player to choose one of Dante's four combat styles; each style has a different focus and techniques. Dante can switch between all four equipped weapons (two guns, two melees) on the fly, allowing for far greater combat freedom and variety than in previous Devil May Cry games. Style selection is available at checkpoints and at the beginning of each level. The styles are ""Trickster"", for dodging and agility; ""Swordmaster"", with abilities for swords and other weapons; ""Gunslinger"", with firearms techniques; and ""Royal Guard"", which allows a player to repel attacks with a button press (storing energy for retaliation). Later in the game, two additional styles become unlocked: ""Quicksilver"", slowing enemies, while the character attacks at normal speed; and ""Doppelgänger"", which creates a shadow double who fights alongside Dante. A second player may control the shadow double by pressing ""Start"" on a second controller. A two-player mode, similar to the Doppelgänger style, is accessible while Dante and Vergil battle Arkham.[6] In the special edition Vergil has another style, ""Dark Slayer"", which is similar to Trickster. The Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition version of the game makes some changes to the gameplay. Along with making Vergil a playable character, other changes included an additional survival mode called ""Bloody Palace"" (which originally appeared in the second game) with 9,999 levels; a Jester fight early in the game, with optional fights later; a ""Turbo Mode"", increasing game speed by 20 percent; an easier GOLD mode ""continue"" feature, allowing a player to revive a character or restart a lost fight, and rebalanced difficulty levels. Vergil's gameplay differed from Dante's; although Dante was weaker than Vergil in terms of skills and combos, he was easier to control. Because of the game's space limitations, not all of Vergil's moves were included in the special edition. Vergil has one style, ""Dark Slayer"" (similar to Dante's ""Trickster"" style), with evasive maneuvers which can be leveled-up twice like Dante's four styles. He has three weapons: a katana known as Yamato, Beowulf gauntlets and greaves and the Force Edge broadsword. Vergil has two ranges of attack: ""Summoned Swords"" (creating magical swords for a variety of effects) and ""Judgment Cut"" (creating spheres of force). The new boss is Jester, a character encountered several times in first-edition cutscenes but not fought. In Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition, he is a boss who may be fought three times. The Nintendo Switch version of Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition added the ability to switch between styles at any point during combat. Plot See also: Characters of Devil May Cry Devil May Cry 3 starts with Dante's yet-unnamed shop. A mysterious man, Arkham, arrives with an invitation from Dante's brother Vergil in the form of a demonic attack. After Dante defeats a group of demons, a huge tower erupts from the ground nearby, eclipsing the sprawling city surrounding it. Sensing that Vergil is on top of the structure, Dante interprets this as a challenge. He begins fighting more demons during his journey, some of which become his weapons once defeated. Dante is attacked by a woman on a motorcycle who turns out to be Mary, Arkham's daughter, who wants revenge on her father for causing her mother's death. It is revealed that Arkham works for Vergil; they plan to take Dante's half of their mother's amulet and use its power on the tower to connect the human and demonic worlds. After a number of battles and an encounter with a being named Jester, Dante reaches the tower's summit and battles Vergil. Vergil defeats Dante by stabbing him with his own sword, Rebellion, steals his amulet and leaves. Dante's blood releases a seal on Rebellion, causing Dante's dormant demonic powers to emerge, and he sets out in pursuit, only to be swallowed by a giant whale-like demon. After escaping from the beast, Dante catches Vergil in a control room in the tower's basement, where Vergil cannot reactivate the tower. The brothers fight again, until they are interrupted by Mary and Jester. Jester reveals himself to be Arkham, who has manipulated them all to reactivate the tower in order to reach the demonic world. There he plans to steal the Force Edge, the dormant form of Sparda's sword with his power, using it to rule a demon-infested Earth. The tower transforms as the spell is broken; Arkham is carried to the summit, and Vergil disappears in the confusion. Dante battles his way back up the tower, fighting Mary for the right to pursue Arkham. He is victorious, and Mary lends him her most powerful weapon. Reaching the summit, Dante crosses to the demonic world and catches Arkham, who has by now assumed Sparda's demonic form. Overwhelmed by power, Arkham transforms into a blob-like creature and attacks Dante. During their fight, Vergil reappears, and the brothers work together to expel Arkham from the demonic world. Weakened, Arkham lands on the tower where Mary finds him. She renounces her name and calls herself Lady, a nickname given to her by Dante because she refused to tell him her name, before killing him. In the demonic world, Dante and Vergil fight for ownership of the Force Edge and the amulet halves. After Vergil's defeat, he remains as the portal closes, vanishing with his half of the amulet. Dante meets Lady outside the tower. They become friends and begin a partnership as demon-slayers; Dante ends up naming his shop ""Devil May Cry"". A scene after the credits shows Vergil in the demonic world, weak but determined, as he charges into battle against his father's old foe Mundus."

The game is a turn-based strategy RPG in the vein of Final Fantasy Tactics. Classes gain abilities by gaining character levels, and can level up those abilities through use. New items and equipment can be bought or won in battle, and can be powered up up by entering and winning battles inside a given item. Characters can also ""gang up"" on enemies by performing combos that are activated by positioning other characters near an attacking character. This action only uses the attacking character's turn, leaving the others free to attack again. Clever coordination can have characters attacking quite a few times per turn. New characters can be created (or even reborn as other classes or just more powerful versions of the same class) by petitioning (or even bribing with special items) the Dark Assembly with ""Mana"" you earn by defeating enemies."

The spell turns the king, King Trode, into a troll; the princess, Medea, into a horse; and the rest of the castle’s inhabitants into plants. The only one left unaffected is the unnamed protagonist, a Trodain guard. The guard, King Trode, and Princess Medea set out on a quest to track down Dhoulmagus and break the spell. They are joined by Yangus, a bandit whose life the hero saves from a collapsing bridge; Jessica, a mage seeking to avenge her brother; and Angelo, a Templar Knight with a penchant for flirting and gambling. Tracking Dhoulmagus' murderous path, the party journeys west, across the ocean. Eventually, the group hunts down Dhoulmagus and kills him, but Dhoulmagus' death fails to break the spell. Jessica claims Dhoulmagus' scepter, and soon after disappears. Jessica later returns, possessed by the staff and battles the remaining party members in an attempt to murder a young man. After the party releases Jessica from her possession, Jessica tells them that the scepter contains the spirit of Rhapthorne, the Lord of Darkness, who was imprisoned in the scepter long ago by seven sages. He seeks to escape from his prison by killing the descendants of the sages. When Jessica explains this, the scepter takes control of a magician’s dog, Sir Leopold, and kills the magician’s assistant, who was one of the descendants of the sages. The party attempts to seek out and defend the remaining descendants, but Leopold manages to murder most of them, until the scepter comes into the possession of Marcello, Angelo's power hungry half-brother. Marcello kills the last remaining descendant of the sages, but manages to contain Rhapthorne for a time. Eventually, the party engages Marcello for murdering a High priest, expending Marcello's energy and releasing Rhapthorne. The party, aided by the godbird Empryea, faces Rhapthorne and defeats him. With Rhapthorne dead, King Trode, Princess Medea, and the people of Trodain are returned to normal. Months later, the protagonist escorts Medea to Savella Cathedral for her arranged marriage to the spoiled Prince Charmles of Argonia, but before the ceremony can take place, the protagonist and Medea escape from Savella Cathedral and live happily together. In an alternate ending, it is discovered that the protagonist is the lost prince of Argonia. Because he is a prince, the King of Argonia decides to allow the protagonist to marry Medea."

This game was released on November 16, 2005 and is playable only on the PlayStation 2 video game console. Dynasty Warriors 5: Xtreme Legends does not allow the player to play Musou Mode or Free Mode if the player does not possess the original Dynasty Warriors 5 game disk. New game modes included Destiny Mode, Xtreme Mode, and Legend Mode. Xtreme Mode is a parallel to Shura Mode in Dynasty Warriors 5 Special, in which the objective of the game is for the human-controlled character to survive as long as possible while collecting gold dropped by enemies to regain health and increase stats temporarily. In Destiny Mode, the player is first allowed to customize a character. After creating a personalized character, a player will be asked to join the Kingdom of Shu, Wei and Wu. While in this mode, you will be playing as a character with very few attacks (starting off with only 2 fundamental hits) and will be ""protected"" by a chosen officer near the character. The officer will heal the character continuously when injured during battle, so long as the character is nearby. A unique feature of Destiny Mode is that at times the player is given the option to betray one force, while setting a ruse for another. For example, a player receives a letter from Cao Cao, the King of Wei, in which he asks the player to defect from the Kingdom of Wu to the Kingdom of Wei. If the player defers the offer to switch sides their commander may approach them in the hopes of creating a ruse to destroy the opposing force. If the player chooses to accept the option from their commander they will fight for the other side temporarily. When the time is right their original commander will have them move the opposing commander to a set position which will trigger their ruse and supporting units will ambush the opposing commander to support the player's defection."

However, the game is heavy on various action-oriented sequences, from tasks that must be completed within a limited amount of time to quick time events, which require the player to press the correct button during a scene. The game emphasizes realism in the player's interaction with the environment. For example, picking up a rag and cleaning the floor requires the player to move the mouse or the analog stick back and forth, imitating the actual movements of the object. Dialogue with character often imposes time limits on the player; failure to choose the optimal response in time will prompt the game to choose another, not always the optimal one.

While Ed moans, Al consoles, and Armstrong flexes, the train is suddenly attacked by terrorists. The skirmish eventually ends with one destroyed train and the brothers in the town of New Heissgart, looking for a ride to Central. There, they meet a girl named Armony and learn more of the Philosopher's Catalyst, an item nearly as powerful as the Philosopher's Stone itself, but used to increase the efficiency of alchemy. The Philosopher's Catalyst seems to be directly linked with the berserk chimeras running about, the rogue military force, and the gathering of alchemists in the town. The Elrics soon find that their simple mission for a train turns into much more as they learn about the Catalyst and the dark mysteries surrounding it."

Playable by up to four players simultaneously, the goal is a simple one: destroy all the enemies in your path, while searching for a way to exit each world. Standing between you and the exit are traps and hordes of enemies that spew forth from generators scattered about the environment. Destroying these generators is the only way to stem the tide of evil warriors. Eight characters are initially selectable -- with others hidden in the game ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous. A knight, sorceress, dwarf, and jester are just a small cross-section of the different classes, with each possessing a unique power to aid them in their quest. The special powers' effectiveness increases as your Turbo meter fills, and slowly regenerates over time. Aiding your slaughter of the swarms of evildoers is a plethora of items: explosive magic vials, multiple projectile attacks, and limited invulnerability are just a few of the many items that can be found or purchased. Unlike the original arcade titles, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy has a finite end, one which players will uncover after traversing the game's 60 stages. Features: * Hack-and-slash action in the true spirit of the Gauntlet legacy * Eight different character types, each with specific powers and abilities * Character develop with experience to become mighty warriors * Up to four players battle evil together in same-screen multiplayer adventure"

As part of the village's tradition, he is taken by a group of warriors to a castle surrounded by water and locked inside one of the sarcophagi in a crypt. Some time after the warriors depart, a tremor runs through the castle, and Ico is able to take advantage of it to escape his confines. As he searches the castle, he comes across Yorda, a captive girl who speaks in an unknown language. Ico helps Yorda escape, but finds that she is hunted by shadow-like creatures (the souls of other horned children sacrificed to the fortress) that attempt to drag her body into the portals from which they emerged. Though Ico cannot be harmed by the shadows and is able to drive them away from Yorda, he finds he cannot defeat the enemies with his simple weapons. The pair make their way through the abandoned castle, eventually arriving at the bridge leading to land. As they cross, the Queen, ruler of the fortress and Yorda's mother, appears and tells Yorda that as her daughter she cannot leave the castle. Ico and Yorda attempt to flee, but the Queen destroys part of the bridge in their path; although Yorda tries to save him, Ico falls off the bridge and loses consciousness. *Japan release only--Co-Op Info: This mode is only available after completing the game.

As a result, you are transported to medieval Japan. You encounter the half-demon Inuyasha, who introduces you to Kagome Higurashi, the heroine of the anime series. Together you embark on a journey to retrieve scattered pieces of the Sacred Jewel and to find a way to get back home. This is a fairly traditional Japanese-style RPG with random encounters and turn-based combat viewed from over-the-shoulder perspective. You can attack physically, use special techniques, and power up to combo attacks with multiple characters."

Unfortunately the prince stands a little less than half a foot tall, so recreating the stars will require some effort. Enter the Katamari, a sphere the prince can push around our world to “roll up” items increasing the Katamari’s size until it’s suitable for the King. Taking place in stylized versions of Japanese houses, cities, and environs, the prince pushes the Katamari around collecting items which adhere to it. At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and other bigger items. Players steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos. Wanting to challenge the prince, the King sets requirements on the Katamari’s size and sets time limits on the level. Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions. The world of Katamari Damacy is brought to life with off-beat animation and a catchy soundtrack. Players can find presents hidden in the levels that contain accessories for the prince. Two players can also battle head-to-head in a Katamari competition."

Patterson stows away aboard the fictional U-Boat U-4902 and infiltrates the German U-boat base in Lorient, France, destroying 4902 and two more U-boats and crippling the port; during his infiltration, he crosses paths with an SS Hauptsturmführer named Rudolf Ulbricht von Sturmgeist conducting an inspection, but Sturmgeist, unaware of Patterson's presence, leaves shortly before the base is destroyed. Shortly after Patterson completes his mission in Lorient, the OSS discovers that the Germans are building a secret weapon, but their contact in the Dutch Resistance goes missing. Patterson is sent to drop with the 82nd Airborne during Operation Market Garden to find him, meeting up with the Resistance and learning the contact is being held in a Nazi-occupied manor. After infiltrating the manor, Patterson locates the contact and rescues him from German custody. The OSS learns from the contact that the secret weapon is a highly advanced jet fighter called HO-IX, which has the potential to change the tide of airpower over Europe if it reaches production. Patterson is sent to sabotage the aircraft's production, however en route he is instructed to cross the Nijmegen Bridge, disarm the explosives wired to the bridge, and send supplies to the besieged British 1st Airborne Division trapped in Arnhem. The OSS makes contact with Patterson again, informing him that they have tracked down Sturmgeist, and learned he is the officer in charge of the HO-IX project. Patterson is sent to Emmerich to track Sturmgeist, pursuing him aboard the SS Officer's personal armored train, but Patterson is unable to catch him before he escapes. Patterson abandons the train and proceeds to the secret aircraft facility outside Gotha on foot, destroying vital German supplies in a railroad depot before proceeding to the facility where the secret aircraft is being held. Once there, Patterson sabotages the facility and production lines, broadcasts the location of the facility to the Allies, and confronts Sturmgeist and his guards in the hangar of the HO-IX, killing him and using the HO-IX to escape the facility as it is destroyed by an Allied bombing raid."

Journey to Jaburo takes place during the One Year War, and depicts the crew of the White Base making their way from the Side 7 sector of space colonies to the Federation headquarters at Jaburo. The game starts at Amuro Ray's home of Side 7, where three Zaku mobile suits attack the Federation's prototype mobile suit weapons. Amuro, in the confusion, fights the Zaku units in the Gundam, and is assigned to the White Base as the Gundam's pilot. After the White Base leaves the colony, it is pursued by Char Aznable, ""The Red Comet"". Char attacks the White Base during re-entry (where the power of the Gundam's beam rifle was revealed), which diverts them into the Zeon-controlled territory of North America. After going through many Zeon defenses (including Garma Zabi in Seattle), the White Base heads into Asia, where they battle Ramba Ral, an ace pilot who raised Sayla Mass when she was a child. After Ramba Ral commits suicide by jumping into Gundam's hand with a grenade, the White Base crew makes their way to Belfast for repairs. After they leave Belfast, they eventually make it to Jaburo, where Char's ""Mad Angler"" squadron finds the location of the base, and launches a massive attack to conquer it. The Zeon forces are beaten back, and the White Base, now dubbed the ""13th Autonomous Mobile Squadron"", heads out into space."

Ivoire consists of vast seas and numerous islands; it used to be a peaceful place, but an ancient (and powerful) force is now threatening life in the various lands. The character you control in the game is Marona, a 13 year old orphaned girl. Marona has the ability to communicate with phantoms, an ability that brings a lot of resentment from other people but will help her to head out into the world and solve the problems that are occurring. A phantom known as Ash acts as Marona's guardian; as the game progresses, other phantoms will join your party, each of which have different capabilities. The game features a turn based combat system. During battles, Marona is able to attack enemies by herself, and she can also summon phantoms in her party to help out. To summon phantoms, you will need to confine them to an object on the screen (such as a rock or tree). Once confined to an object, you will then be able to control the phantom in battle, though phantoms only remain controllable for a limited number of turns. The object you confine a phantom to will affect it's abilities; for example, a rock may make a phantom stronger but move slower. By defeating enemies in battle you earn experience points allowing to level up and become more powerful."

The balance between Chaos and Order has been upset and it is Jen's task to restore the balance, all the while hoping to discover the whereabouts of Lewis.

When Jen is incapacitated in combat, Scree must quickly restore her to life within a time limit; failure to do so prematurely ends the game. Combat is heavily based on ""finishing moves"" and Jen's ability to transform into demonic forms. There are four demons Jen can merge herself with; they are obtained one by one as the game's narrative advances.

The psitanium affected the local wildlife, giving them limited psychic powers, such as bears with the ability to attack with telekinetic claws and cougars with pyrokinesis. The Native Americans of the area called psitanium ""whispering rock"", which they used to build arrowheads. When settlers began inhabiting the region, the psychoactive properties of the meteor slowly drove them insane. An asylum was built to house the afflicted, but within fifteen years the asylum had more residents than the town did. The government relocated the remaining inhabitants and flooded the crater to prevent further settlement, creating what is now Lake Oblongata. The asylum still stands but has fallen into disrepair."

Rayman: The hero of his land. Uses his hair to glide. He is the main character of the Rayman games, he may be somewhat small in stature, but he makes up for size with speed, agility, and a highly likable personality. His theme music uses some kind of banjo-like instrument and is a very catchy tune. He also has a skin of himself called Dark Rayman who is the main antagonist of the Xbox and Nintendo GameCube versions of Rayman Arena. Though it is only one of Rayman's skins, the game refers to him as Dark Rayman. It is the same as Rayman except for his appearance, which is drastically different from that in Rayman: A darker, almost black, purple shirt, with an ""X"" on it, fairly orange shoes, red hands, a yellow bandanna around his neck, and completely red eyes. He is unlocked by completing the Master Challenges. His music is the same as Rayman, because he's his skin (in fact, Rayman is the only character who only has one alternate skin). (GameCube/Xbox only) Globox: Rayman's dimwitted friend. Blows up like a balloon to glide. He makes appearances in many Rayman games. He may be daft and awkward, but he has spirit. His music includes a trombone, among other instruments. Dark Globox: In the Gamecube and Xbox versions of Rayman Arena, the player can unlock him. He's just like Globox but he is purple with a skull on his back. Another skin has a wolf on the back. He may look angry, but he is actually dumber than the actual Globox. He hangs on to an invisible purple lum to glide. His theme music is like a hundred singing frogs with a trombone like Globox. It was used as Globette's theme in Rayman Rush (not to be confused with Uglette, Globox's wife) .(GameCube/Xbox only) Tily: A small, furry fairy. Uses her wings to glide. She seems to be Ly's sister. Her tune is happy and fairy-ish. Pre-release posters of Rayman implied that Ly may have been a playable character, but however Tily seems to have replaced her. Henchman 800: A robotic pirate from Rayman 2. Uses the jet on his back to glide. He is a Henchman for Admiral Razorbeard. His music is a rock tune. Henchman 1000: An older model of the robot pirate. He seems to be a pirate/gangster/cowboy/salsa dancer robot. Like Henchman 800, He uses the jet on his back to glide. His tune is a rock n roll/rodeo tune. Teensies: Two senile old dwarves that work together in a race. One spins the other around the other's head to glide. In Rayman 2 it shows that they forgot who the king was so they take turns wearing the crown, and being king. Their music uses a synthesizer. Admiral Razorbeard: Short in both stature and temper, Razorbeard is the robotic admiral of the evil robot pirates. Spins his arms around to glide. He was the final boss of Rayman 2. His theme song uses an electric guitar. Razorwife: Razorbeard's awful wife, called Mrs. Razorbeard in the European version and the U.S. select screen. Flaps her arms around to glide. Her humorous tune is her dreadful opera singing."

This is the story of the 1983 movie Scarface in which Tony Montana dies during a attack from a rival gang on his mansion at the end. The game now puts the player in the shoes of Tony a few moments before the gang hits his office. After he successfully defends his mansion, his empire lies in ruins. But Tony wouldn't be Tony Montana if he would just give up, so it is the player's goal to reclaim Miami once again. To do so, he has to earn money and respect. The only way to earn money in Miami is to deal drugs. At the beginning the stuff is bought in small amounts and personally sold to the dealers. Eventually, however, Tony can set up so-called ""Fronts"" which are legitimate shops (like a car seller) in which drugs are sold in very large amounts. By overtaking ""Fronts"", Tony also increases his control over the current district of Miami. To completely overtake one part of town, all the enemy gangs scattered around in small groups must be eliminated. After a deal, Tony has to launder the money at the local bank and have it transferred to his account. He then can buy ""exotics"" for his mansion like an expensive vase or a new car with a driver. When talking with a dealer or trying to get cop heat down, the player has to play a mini-game that determines if Tony is successful and if so, how much he gets for the drugs or how much heat he loses. Respect is earned by increasing Tony's territory, buying exotics and earning ""balls"" in fights and while driving. The enemies have different target zones which give a different amount of balls on a hit. This also fills up Tony's 'ball-meter"". Once this is full he can enter a kind of god mode in which he is invulnerable and has unlimited ammo. Tony also gets health when killing someone in this mode. If he is driving a car he gets balls when making stunts like driving on the wrong side of the road or dodging an incoming car. As in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, the player is free to roam the city of Miami and there are also some side-missions with racing events."

You have to stop a spinning slot machine at the right time, in order to perform an action successfully.

You can explore the world in a non-linear fashion, visit many optional areas and fight monsters at your will.

Featuring ""stroke-shaded"" animation-style graphics, a ""Wild West"" setting, and a completely 3D game engine (not just for battles, as in the previous games), Wild Arms 3 is designed to make good use of the power of the PlayStation 2. Wild Arms 3 features four main characters and takes the time to let players become acquainted with each of them. The ""drifters"" Virginia, Gallows, Jet, and Clive are four very different adventurers whose paths intertwine toward a shared destiny. Though each has his or her own personal motivations, all four seek an explanation for why the once-verdant lands of Filgaia have become dry and barren. Differences must be overcome and the characters must act in harmony if they are to truly understand the ancient mystical forces at work. As the drifters move through the desolate land of Filgaia, they are challenged with a number of mysteries to solve and barriers to overcome. The different special abilities of each character must be used to solve different parts of the game's complex puzzles. A technique dubbed ""expressive communication"" is designed to allow players to quickly gauge the moods and emotions of the onscreen characters. Monsters, villains, and other horrible creatures stand between the drifters and their destinations as well. The Wild Arms 3 turn-based battle system is designed to offer players an intricate level of control, allowing tactics that make wise use of the various powers and weaponry of the drifters while presenting combat with cinematic flair. Wild Arms 3 delivers everything RPG gamers expect: an in-depth storyline, puzzling dungeons & a unique battling system. Journey along with Virginia, Jet, Clive and Gallows and discover the mystery behind the Prophets to revive the memories of Filgaia. Explore dungeons to unlock secret pathways and find mythical treasures. Gun Blazing shoot-outs deliver intense cinematic battles. Wild Arms 3 embodies tried-and-true elements of a role-playing classic."

Before starting, you have to choose a symbol, assign parameters to it (based on monster points, action points and power points) and buy a starter kit card deck. In a typical campaign game, you start in the entrance hall, where you manage your cards and monsters. To duel, you choose one of the four areas with five levels each, and defeat the opponents. New monsters are acquired by winning the match. The turn-based duels are played as a card game. Both characters start with a deck of cards and a number of health points. When a health status reaches zero, the battle is over. You attack your opponent by summoning monsters and assigning abilities to them. Trick cards can be used to gain both offensive and defensive advantages. Before each duel, you have to pick a monster that is up for ante, and the fighting is influenced by various parameters, including the land form you are playing on."

Dingo escapes with Taper and heads for Mars."
